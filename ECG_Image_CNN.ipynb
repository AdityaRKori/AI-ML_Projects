        "# Task\n",
        "Generate Python code to perform the following steps: 1. Install necessary libraries (`tensorflow`, `kaggle`, `streamlit`, `Pillow`, `pandas`). 2. Set up the Kaggle API. 3. Download and unzip the \"ECG Image Dataset\" from Kaggle using `kagglehub` (\"erhmrai/ecg-image-data\"). 4. Load and preprocess a reduced subset of the image data for training and validation using `tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory` with `image_size=(128, 128)`, `batch_size=32`, `validation_split=0.2`, and subsets 'training' and 'validation'. Get and print the class names. Configure datasets for performance using `.cache()` and `.prefetch()`. 5. Build a 2D CNN model with a Rescaling layer, three Conv2D+MaxPooling2D blocks (32, 64, 128 filters), a Flatten layer, a Dense layer (128 units, relu), and a final Dense output layer (5 units, softmax). Print the model summary. 6. Compile the model using 'adam' optimizer and 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' loss. Train the model on the reduced training dataset for a suitable number of epochs (less than 20 due to reduced data size), using the validation dataset. 7. Save the trained model to \"heart_ecg_model.h5\". 8. Generate the code for a Streamlit app (`app.py`) that loads the saved model, uses the class names ['F', 'N', 'Q', 'S', 'V'], defines specific recommendations for each class, provides a file uploader for image prediction, displays the uploaded image, shows prediction probabilities in a pandas DataFrame, and displays the final diagnosis and recommendation using `st.success` for 'N' and `st.error`/`st.warning` for other classes. 9. Generate the content for a `requirements.txt` file listing `streamlit`, `tensorflow`, `Pillow`, `pandas`, and `kaggle`."
